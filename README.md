This course will first introduce you to some basic terms of statistics, such as probability, distribution, hypotheses, and CLT (Central Limit Theorem) theorem, the essentials to learning Statistics for Data Science. Next, you will comprehend the Normal distribution with the help of examples. The examples of the normal distribution are very helpful in understanding statistics better.

Moving forward with the course, you will be introduced to the hypothesis, which is used to prove or disprove the statements for distribution. Later, you will learn the concept of Sampling distribution briefly with the help of the Central Limit Theorem. Lastly, the tutor will help you to understand the theorem with the help of hypotheses.
